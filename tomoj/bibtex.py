abstract = "Transmission electron tomography is an increasingly common three-dimensional electron microscopy approach
that can provide new insights into the structure of subcellular components. Transmission electron tomography fills the
gap between high resolution structural methods (X-ray diffraction or nuclear magnetic resonance) and optical microscopy.
 We developed new software for transmission electron tomography, TomoJ. TomoJ is a plug-in for the now standard image
 analysis and processing software for optical microscopy, ImageJ."

abstract = "Tilt series are commonly used in electron tomography as a means of collecting three-dimensional information
from two-dimensional projections. A common problem encountered is the projection alignment prior to 3D reconstruction.
Current alignment techniques usually employ gold particles or image derived markers to correctly align the images.
When these markers are not present, correlation between adjacent views is used to align them. However, sequential
pairwise correlation is prone to bias and the resulting alignment is not always optimal."
